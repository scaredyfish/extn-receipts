# Receipts

This is a Chrome extension - currently a work in progress

This extension adds a screenshot icon to the browser which allows you to take a screenshot and also capture any text for the purposes of creating alt text. No OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is used - the text is captured directly from the web page where the screenshot is taken.

## Future Todos:

- Save all images within the selected area
